<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I hold a Bachelor in Commerce degree from India, a Bachelors Degree in Theology from Norway and a Masters degree in Community Development and Social Innovation from Norway. My Masters covers topics such as Community Development, Organizational Leadership and Social Innovation, Value- based Leadership, Human resources and conflict management, Worldviews, Values and Relations in Professional Practice.
